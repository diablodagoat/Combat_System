# Combat_System
This buncha codes are a representation of a simple straight forward (No knockbacks ) combat system using Lua on roblox studio
The local script is the same as every local script firing the server when player click m1 or m2  with considering the different states a player can be in:
-Blocking
-Punching
-Stunned

the server script is as simple as it is controls the status changes a player can have and makes sure every action happens without a problem 
noting that the map i scripted is just a prototype it doesn't have any kind of client replication since it doesn't expect a large amount of player to lag the server 

no data saving are in the map since it just felt raw as every tutorial to just give "kills"-"wins" in a leaderboard and just store it so i left it without any 


the gui sctip is simply including a function that changes the visuality of the gui given to the value given 
considering if i ever needed to add an inventory and i'll need to set the values to true sometimes
